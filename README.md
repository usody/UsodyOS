# UsodyOS

- Under development.

Generate a lightweight Debian-based live ISO that can extract hardware metadata, perform component testing and/or securely erase data on storage devices.

## Build UsodyOS ISO
--------------------

In Debian 12 Bookworm following installation steps:

0. First of all make sure you have git and make packages installed to be able to continue with the next steps. To install them run the following command:

    > sudo apt install git make

1. Clone this repository and go to the repository main folder.

    > git clone https://github.com/usody/UsodyOS.git && cd UsodyOS

2. Install project dependencies if needed by running the following command:

    > sudo make install_build_dependencies

3. Init and update HWMD submodule.

    > git submodule update --init

4. Generate ISO file, execute:

    > sudo make build

At the end of the execution, generate an ISO image inside '*<project-folder>/iso/UsodyOS_{version}.iso*'.

## Test UsodyOS ISO
--------------------

If you want to boot UsodyOS ISO, make sure you have installed *qemu-system*, then execute:

> sudo make boot_iso

(Opt) If you want to clean up all the files generated by the image (including iso file), execute:

> sudo make build_clean
